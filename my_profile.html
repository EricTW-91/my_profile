        <h3>A brief about me</h3>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Eric from Taiwan, born in July, 1991. I was an PLC engineer before I came to Vancouver.<br>
            The dog in the photo is Cappu. The reason why I named him that is because I can name my second dog as Ccino. However, I haven't got a second one yet.<br>
        </p>

        <h3 class="lowerh3">My hobbies</h3>

        <h3 class="lowerh3">My goal in Vancouver</h3>
        <p>My short term goal is to practice both English and Coding. In addition to this, I like to meet different people and make some friends.<br>
        The final goal will be getting a job in Canada or other countries to get more experience.</p>
